####PS1.

####1.

The number of outcomes is `r 6*6*6` for a fair dice rolled three times.

####2.

The potential outcomes for two rolls is `r 6*6`, and there are 2 potential rolls that give a sum of 3. That means the chances of getting a sum of 3 is `r 2/36`.

####3.

For 25 people in a room:

```{r}
pbirthday(25) # There's a base function that does this, weirdly enough
1 - prod(1 - (0:24)/365) # testing with my own math
```

For 50 people in a room:

```{r}
pbirthday(50) # There's a base function that does this, weirdly enough
1 - prod(1 - (0:49)/365) # testing with my own math
```
